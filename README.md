# PortTest
A simple tool to test UDP endpoint connectivities.

In Windows it is quite easy to test TCP connectivities, there are also tons of tools can meet IT's need to do so. But for UDP protocol there is no built-in tool to do the test.

Since the stateless protocol is quite easy to monitor from application. Just wrote a simple tool sample and you can also fork it into your own projects.


Building instruction:
* You will need commandlineparser, make sure you install it.
* I just put simple error handling logic, add your own logic if needed.

Happy coding..
